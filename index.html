      <p>Hello! My name is Seth Greene!</p>
      <p>I am located in Cleveland County North Carolina.</p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My brother introduced me to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy's</a> Javascript courses when I was 12 or 13. I instantly loved it and began making little games daily for over a year before deciding to take on a bigger project with some help from another guy. After running into a bunch of bugs and problems I didn't know what to do and gave up, going for a long time not programming at all.</p>
        
  <p>I still had a love for game development though and decided I wanted to do it "for real", I moved to Unity to learn C# (I tried to learn some graphic design in Blender as well), unfortunately I didn't know where to start and got overwhelmed extremely fast. Discouraged, I gave up programming for years (I believe I was 14-15 at the time).</p> 
      
  <p>I ended up getting a manual labor job working for my town right out of high school, I worked that for a year unsure of what I wanted to do but then I came across a youtube video detailing a "Software engineer roadmap" which recommended taking Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science as your first step. After (almost) finishing Harvard's class (haven't fininshed my final yet), I decided I wanted to go through a bootcamp to get a new job as quickly as possible, so now I'm here!</p>
    
  <p>I've only met three people from this industry so far, but it's seems like a fantastic environment and I'm excited to meet/work with more people over the coming years! </p>
